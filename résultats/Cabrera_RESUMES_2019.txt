Conclusion : 

The  massive  access  of  the  Internet  has  changed  multiple  as-  
pects of our lives, and the way we ﬁnd and apply for a job offer  
is  not  an  exception.  Although  the  use  of  computers  and  the  In-  
ternet has made easier to ﬁnd job offers and potential candidates  
to send their résumés or curricula vitae, it has negatively affected  
the performance of human resource managers during the selection  
process. Human resource managers have trouble to ﬁnd rapidly the  
candidates, among all who applied, that meet the job requirements  
and should be called for an interview.  

We presented two innovative methods for ranking résumés by  
relevance, making it easier for human resource managers to iden-  
tify candidates with the desired characteristics. The methods here  
presented are innovative because they make use only of the ré-  
sumés  sent  in  response  to  a  job  offer.  These  methods  contrast  
with state-of-the-art methods that usually compare résumés and  
job offers with proximity measures. Our methods are language in-  
dependent and do not need semantic resources to work. Moreover,  
the methods presented here are statistically better than a random  
baseline or a baseline grounded on the similarity between résumés  
and a job offer.  

Moreover, we presented two different ways to apply Relevance  
Feedback in a résumé ranker. One method for applying Relevance  
Feedback  works  at  a  general  level  (Relevance  Factor),  while  the  
other method works at a ﬁner lexical one (Vocabulary Scoring). Al-  
though the Relevance Factor helps to improve résumé rankings, we  
ﬁnd that it is its use along with Vocabulary Scoring that helps us  
to reach a Mean Average Precision of 0.937. Put differently, by us-  
ing the Relevance Factor with Vocabulary Scoring we can correctly  
rank almost every résumé. As a consequence, we can reduce the  
time needed by human resource managers to ﬁnd the résumés of  
relevant applicants. It is important to note that the very good re-  
sults obtained with Vocabulary Scoring reinforces the concept that  
relevant résumés share more characteristics with themselves than  
with irrelevant ones, as seen in our previous works.  

We believe that, within the résumés we can intrinsically ﬁnd a  
“facial composite” of the ideal candidate, and possibly the “facial  
composite” that represents the unqualiﬁed candidates. It may be  
these “facial composites” that enable us to rank résumés without  
the use of a job offer or semantic resources.  

We  consider  that  methodologies  based  only  on  résumés  and  
their vocabularies are the future of résumé rankers. The main rea-  
son  to  think  this  is  that  they  are  capable  of  offering  excellent  
performance  without  being  limited  to  one  domain  or  language.  
Despite  these  methods  were  created  to  be  used  in  a  particular  
database, where it was impossible to have access to every job of-  
fer, we believe that it can be used in any database of résumés, only  
if these are separated by job postings. Furthermore, the methods  
here presented do not make use of any kind of semantic resources,  
which can make them easier to implement in under-resources lan-  
guages.  

There  are  still  things  that  must  be  studied  with  this  kind  of  
methods. In the ﬁrst place are the temporal aspects. We assumed  
in this article that all the résumés were present at the same time,  
but  in  real  life  this  may  not  be  true.  On  occasions,  the  process  
of recruitment and selection are done in parallel, i.e., once a ré-  
sumé arrives to a human resource manager, it is analyzed. We have  

to consider as well the evolution of the person speciﬁcation over  
time. In some cases, human resource managers are obliged to be-  
come  more  or  less  strict  in  order  to  ﬁlter  the  applicants.  These  
changes, in consequence, will affect the human resource managers’  
perception regarding the relevance of applicants. Due to this effect,  
the way to apply our methods may need to change, and we should  
evaluate until which extent they remain valid. However, despite all,  
the proposed methods could be used to evaluate a posteriori the  
reasons why a group of candidates was chosen to do an interview.  
Moreover,  other  human  resource managers or  psychologists  may  
ﬁnd useful the tool to determine whether human resource man-  
agers were affected by personality inferences, misspellings or any  
kind of discrimination.  

Another aspect to take into account is the way to match terms  
or concepts and n -grams. These representations are not the same,  
and this can infuse diﬃculty to some degree in the application of  
our methods. Put differently, a concept may be diﬃcult to repre-  
sent with an n -gram. Finally, it should be analyzed the economics  
and whether human resource managers will adopt these methods  
to make their tasks easier.  

Regarding the scalability of the methods here presented, we do  
not observe any particular problem. As we indicated in Section 5 ,  
the methods were called using the program GNU Parallel , meaning  
that  each  job  posting  was  analyzed  using  different  CPU  threads.  
This indicates that multiple job postings can be processed at the  
same time without any collision. Furthermore, it is possible to par-  
allelize the similarity between résumés, i.e., to use several threads  
to calculate multiple Dice’s Coeﬃcient scores at the same time. The  
only aspect to take into consideration is that the vectors represent-  
ing the résumés should be accessible to every thread. At the end,  
all the methods described in this work can be easily scaled and  
distributed in a cluster.  

In the future, we would like to use word embedding in order  
to  calculate  the  proximity  between  résumés  differently.  It  could  
also be useful for Vocabulary Scorings. In addition, we will work  
on the improvements described in the discussion. Since the meth-  
ods developed here are language independent, it will be easy to  
test them on other languages than French. Although this last task  
can be diﬃcult to achieve due to the lack of a corpus of real se-  
lection  processes.  During  the  experimentation,  we  observed  that  
our methods can keep a good performance when they are tested  
25 Therefore, we  
on an encrypted version of the data set here used.  
can rely on this clue that for other languages, the methods should  
work as well.  

In conclusion, we hope that our methods and results will attract  

new and deeper research in this domain.

25 We did not achieve the same results in the encrypted data set, as the résumés  
were encrypted without doing a deep pre-processing, like lemmatization or stop  
words deletion. Thus, the résumés contained a greater variety of terms and noisy  
words.
