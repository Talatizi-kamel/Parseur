In this paper a sentence compression tool is de
scribed. We describe how an input sentence gets 
analysed by using a.o. a tagger, a shallow parser 
and a subordinate clause detector, and how, based 
on this analysis, several compressed versions of this 
sentence are generated, each with an associated es
timated probability. These probabilities were esti
mated from a parallel transcript/subtitle corpus. To 
avoid ungrammatical sentences, the tool also makes 
use of a number of rules. The evaluation was done 
on three different pronunciation speeds, averaging 
sentence reduction rates of 40% to 17%. The num
ber of reasonable reductions ranges between 32.9% 
and 51%, depending on the average estimated pro
nunciation speed.
