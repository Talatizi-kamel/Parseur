evaluation 

a new content-based method for 
systems without 
the 
human models which is used to produce system rankings. 
The research is carried out using a new content-based 
evaluation framework called FRESA to compute a variety of 
divergences among probability distributions. We apply our 
comparison framework to various well-established content-based 
evaluation measures in text summarization such as COVERAGE, 
their 
RESPONSIVENESS, PYRAMIDS 
associations 
text 
including 
generic multi-document summarization in English and French, 
focus-based multi-document 
summarization in English and 
generic single-document summarization in French and Spanish.
