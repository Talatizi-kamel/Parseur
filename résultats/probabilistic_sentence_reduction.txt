titre :Probabilistic Sentence Reduction Using Support Vector Machines 
Abstract : 

This paper investigates a novel application of sup
port vector machines (SVMs) for sentence reduction. 
We also propose a new probabilistic sentence reduc
tion method based on support vector machine learn
ing. Experimental results show that the proposed 
methods outperform earlier methods in term of sen
tence reduction performance.
