This paper presents Topiary, a headline
generation system that creates very 
short, informative summaries for news 
stories by combining sentence compres
sion and unsupervised topic discovery. 
We will show that the combination of 
linguistically motivated sentence com
pression with statistically selected topic 
terms performs better than either alone, 
according to some automatic summary 
evaluation measures. In addition we de
scribe experimental results establishing 
an appropriate extrinsic task on which to 
measure the effect of summarization on 
human performance. We demonstrate 
the usefulness of headlines in compar
ison to full texts in the context of this 
extrinsic task.
