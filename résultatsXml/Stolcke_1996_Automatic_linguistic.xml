As speech recognition moves toward more unconstrained domains 
such as conversational speech, we encounter a need to be able to 
segment (or resegment) waveforms and recognizer output into lin
guistically meaningful units, such a sentences. Toward this end, 
we present a simple automatic segmenter of transcripts based on 
N-gram language modeling. We also study the relevance of sev
eral word-level features for segmentation performance. Using only 
word-level information, we achieve 85% recall and 70% precision 
on linguistic boundary detection.
